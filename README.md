This program implements the word guessing game called Hangman.
 
Some of this code is originally from a CS instructor (@author CS302, 2009,2012 by Jim Skrentny) used as course work, where students are asked to complete the program in order to make it work.

The original code can be found here:

This program has been not only completed by me (CIMAN01) per original instructions, but I have further modified it to make it simpler (i.e. splitting up code across several classes), more efficient (i.e using enhanced for loops), and more robust (handling special cases for better overall user experience).
